## About

Virtual closet is a Java desktop application with the purpose of *keeping track of items of clothing* in your closet(s),
allowing you to *combine them into outfits* which can be *saved for later viewing and reference*.

**What is Virtual Closet useful for?**

- Individuals interested in fashion
- Keeping track of clothing
- Remembering what clothing you have in your closet(s)
- Recording outfits you've liked in the past
- Testing combinations of clothing you have

## Motivation for the Idea

Often times I rush in the morning to throw together a suitable and tasteful fit, but there are many articles that slip
my mind and sit unused. This is the primary reason I am interested in creating this application; to make choosing an
outfit
a quicker and easier process. It takes time to put on clothing combinations to see if they fit together, which is time
that
can be saved using an application like Virtual Closet.
